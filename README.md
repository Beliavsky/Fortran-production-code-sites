# Fortran production code sites

The fortran-lang [site](https://fortran-lang.org/) has a paragraph explaining **What is Fortran used for?** This could be linked to a gallery of production codes with nice external web sites, ideally with eye-catching graphics. Some sites listed below such as ECMWF may not refer to a single computer code. Here is a starting list that I request people add to -- please create a PR or an issue. I use (C) to designate closed-source commercial projects.

### Astrophysics
[MAS (Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere)](https://www.predsci.com/corona/model_desc.html): Model of the Solar Corona and Inner Heliosphere

### Climate
[MITGCM (general circulation model)](http://paocweb.mit.edu/research-group/mitgcm)

[NOAA-GFDL Flexible Modeling System](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms/)

### Computational Fluid Dynamics
[CFL3D](https://nasa.github.io/CFL3D/): structured-grid, cell-centered, upwind-biased, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) code, used to support numerous NASA programs since the late 1980s

[FUN3D (Fully Unstructured Navier-Stokes)](https://fun3d.larc.nasa.gov/): suite of tools actively developed at NASA that benefits Aeronautics, Space Technology, and Exploration by modeling fluid flow

[MFC (Multi-Component Flow Code)](https://mflowcode.github.io/): exascale compressible multiphase and multiphysics flow code

[OVERFLOW](https://overflow.larc.nasa.gov/?doing_wp_cron=1713101321.4555010795593261718750): uses structured overset grids to simulate fluid flow, and is being used on projects for Aeronautics Research, Science, Space Technology, and Human Exploration Mission Directorates

### Engineering
[ABAQUS](https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/abaqus) -- Finite Element Analysis for Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering (C)

### Quantum Chemistry and Electronic Structure
[NWChem: Open Source High-Performance Computational Chemistry](https://www.nwchem-sw.org/)

[SIESTA (Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulations with Thousands of Atoms)](https://www.simuneatomistics.com/products/siesta-code/)

[Quantum ESPRESSO (opEn Source Package for Research in Electronic Structure, Simulation, and Optimization)](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/)

[VASP (Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package)](https://www.vasp.at/)

### Weather Prediction
[ADCIRC Prediction System](https://coastalresiliencecenter.unc.edu/publications-and-products/adcirc/) -- provides timely, high-resolution information on how coastal storm surge, flooding and winds will impact a [U.S.] coastal community

[ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts)](https://www.ecmwf.int/en/computing)

[Global Forecast System (GFS)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast) -- U.S.

[Unified Model (UM)](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model) -- U.K.
