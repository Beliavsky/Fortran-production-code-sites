# Fortran production code sites

The fortran-lang [site](https://fortran-lang.org/) has a paragraph explaining **What is Fortran used for?** This could be linked to a gallery of production codes with nice external web sites, ideally with eye-catching graphics. Some sites listed below such as ECMWF may not refer to a single computer code. Here is a starting list that I request people add to -- please create a PR or an issue. I use (C) to designate closed-source commercial projects.

### Astrophysics
[MAS (Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere)](https://www.predsci.com/corona/model_desc.html): Model of the Solar Corona and Inner Heliosphere

### Climate
[MITGCM (general circulation model)](http://paocweb.mit.edu/research-group/mitgcm)

[NOAA-GFDL Flexible Modeling System](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fms/)

### Computational Fluid Dynamics
[CFL3D](https://nasa.github.io/CFL3D/): structured-grid, cell-centered, upwind-biased, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) code, used to support numerous NASA programs since the late 1980s

[FUN3D (Fully Unstructured Navier-Stokes)](https://fun3d.larc.nasa.gov/): suite of tools actively developed at NASA that benefits Aeronautics, Space Technology, and Exploration by modeling fluid flow

[MFC (Multi-Component Flow Code)](https://mflowcode.github.io/): exascale compressible multiphase and multiphysics flow code

[OVERFLOW](https://overflow.larc.nasa.gov/?doing_wp_cron=1713101321.4555010795593261718750): uses structured overset grids to simulate fluid flow, and is being used on projects for Aeronautics Research, Science, Space Technology, and Human Exploration Mission Directorates

### Earth Science
[Earth Tide, Load Effect and Monitoring computation](https://www.zcyphygeodesy.com/en/h-col-113.html): includes the basic principles, main formulas and important methods of geodesy on the deforming Earth, by Chuanyin Zhang

### Engineering
[ABAQUS](https://www.3ds.com/products/simulia/abaqus): Finite Element Analysis for Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering (C)

[Horizontal Axis Wind turbine simulation Code 2nd generation (HAWC2)](https://www.hawc2.dk/): aeroelastic code intended for calculating wind turbine response in time domain.
The core of the code was developed mainly within the years 2003-2007, by the Aeroelastic Design Research Program at DTU Wind, DTU Ris√∏ Campus in Denmark.

### Plasma Physics
[EPOCH](https://epochpic.github.io/): particle-in-cell code for plasma physics simulations. An associated paper is [Contemporary particle-in-cell approach to laser-plasma modelling](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0741-3335/57/11/113001), by T. D. Arber et al., <i>Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion</i> (2015).
